# Privacy Policy for Next Check

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]

Thank you for using **Next Check**, a personal budget tracking app designed to operate securely and privately.

## 1. No Data Collection

**Next Check** does **not collect, store, or share any personal data**. All budgeting information entered into the app remains **entirely on your device**, unless you choose to back it up or export it.

We do not transmit any data to our servers or to any third parties.

## 2. Backup and Storage Access

**Next Check** allows you to optionally back up or restore your budgeting data. This process uses your device’s internal storage or cloud storage options (e.g., Google Drive, iCloud), which are managed and controlled by your operating system. We do not access, transmit, or store your backups.

## 3. External Hyperlinks

As a convenience feature, **Next Check** allows users to save and open **external hyperlinks**. These links are user-submitted and, when opened, may launch your device’s web browser or relevant app. Once you leave **Next Check** and visit an external site, that site's privacy policy applies.

**We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third-party websites.**

## 4. Internet Usage

While **Next Check** may use internet access for the purpose of opening user-submitted links or initiating optional user backups, the app **does not transmit any personal or usage data** over the internet on its own.

## 5. No Third-Party Services

The app does not include third-party analytics, advertising, or monitoring tools.

## 6. Children's Privacy

**Next Check** does not knowingly collect any information from users of any age and is safe for all users. If you are under the age of 13, you may use the app under parental supervision as appropriate.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy if app functionality changes in the future. Any significant updates will be reflected in this document and within the app if necessary.
